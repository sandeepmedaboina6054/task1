It only took me a moment
And now I'm imprisoned to your touch (Woah)
I don't know where it's going now
But I know, I need your love

Now, I'll always be here, I won't ever run
'Cause you took the air right out of my lungs

Ah, I lose my breath when you're walkin' in
'Cause when our eyes lock, it's like my heart stops
Ah, I lose my breath when you're walkin' in
You make my knees drop, it's like I'm in shock
